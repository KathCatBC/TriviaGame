Triva Game Brain Storm

Create an object

	in the object will be objects containing
		Question
		4 possible answers
		the correct answer (or the number of the correct answer)


Create a timer

Create a scoreboard, for correct, wrong, & unanswered(time ran out) quesions

Create Start and restart buttons to be used at appropriate times


Logic brainstorm


	User clicks on start button
		Start a loop to go through the question
			Get nth question & answer choices - display them
			Start timer
			Highlight anwers when user hovers over an awswer
			After the users selects an answer
				let the user know if they are right or wrong.
				Increment the appropriate counter
					If wrong indicate the correct answer.
					(add graphics or video clips or sound if there is time to do the coding)
		End loop
		Indicate users score (right/wrong/skipped)
		Ask if the user want to replay the game
			if yes restart (maybe a do while loop at the start since you have to play at least once)
			else
			end of game.
